Next Additions:

1. Dice Roll Display in TUI
Add ASCII art for dice rolls in the TUI.
Shapes:
d4: Triangle
d6: Square
d8: Octahedron
d10: Pentagon
d12: Decagon
d20: Hexagonal design inside a hexagon
Update relevant TUI files displaying dice results.
2. Dice Roll Color Scaling
Implement color scaling for dice rolls:
Scale from red (low rolls) to green (high rolls).
Special colors: 1 as black, 20 as gold.
Ensure this is reflected visually in the dice display panel.
3. Dice Functionality Correction
Confirm and fix the logic for dice rolls using the + modifier:
The + should be applied as a post-modifier (after all dice are rolled), not per roll.
4. Search Output Readability
Improve TUI search output:
Display search results in readable, well-aligned columns with clear headers.
5. Search Warnings Handling
Ensure search warnings are printed to the pseudoterminal, not breaking the TUI layout.
6. Help Menu Consistency
Update the help menu for consistency:
Add missing items and commands.
Provide clear examples for each command.
7. NPC Generation & Character Display
When generating NPCs or displaying character sheets:
Always include ALL character stats.
Show a "contact card" for the character in a new panel on the right during their turn.
Files likely affected:

TUI display/rendering modules
Dice logic/utility modules
Search functionality modules
Help menu/documentation files
NPC/character sheet display modules
Acceptance Criteria:

All visual changes are clear and consistent.
Dice logic behaves as described.
Help and search functions are easy to understand and use.
NPC/character panels show complete information.
